# Binary Tree Construction and Traversal

This C++ program constructs a binary search tree (BST) from 40 random natural numbers (less than 100), saves them in their original generated order, creates a linked list using the nodes of the BST, and performs pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal of the tree.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler

## How to Compile and Run
1. Clone the repository or download the source files (`main.cpp`, `BinaryTree.h`, `LinkedList.h`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the source files.
4. Compile the program using your C++ compiler. For example:
